# Pairs_Trade
Based on cointegration of time series, 
this algorithm will identify suitable pairs and take action (exit/entry) at pre-determined trading signals (Z-scores).

There are four steps in pairs trading:
1) identify pairs - this is the preliminary screening, first by fundamental research then by correlation analysis 
2) cointegration test - the pair of time series has to be co-integrated for pairs trade to work 
3) build strategy - set strategies accoridng to Z-score (exit/entry)
4) performanace measurement
